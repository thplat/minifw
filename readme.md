#Mini-FW

Mini-FW is a mini framework build upon the [Auryn DI-Container](https://github.com/rdlowrey/Auryn).
It's just experimental to play around with Auryns capabilities.


It contains the *Minimap* ORM which is yet in it's early stages of development and will soon be moved
to it's own repository.
